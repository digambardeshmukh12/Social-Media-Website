# Social Media Web Application

This is a responsive social media web application built using Angular and Firebase. The application focuses on user authentication, content sharing, and real-time interactions, following a clean and modular frontend architecture.

The application supports email-based authentication with verification, user profile management, post creation, and reply/comment functionality. Users can interact with content in real time, with data updates handled through Firebase services. The user interface is built using Angular Material to ensure consistency and responsiveness across devices.

The frontend is developed using Angular and TypeScript with a component-based structure. Page-level features such as home, feed, and verification are separated from reusable UI components like authentication, profile handling, post creation, and replies. Routing is handled using Angular Router, and Firebase is initialized during application startup using environment-based configuration.

Firebase is used for authentication, data storage, and backend logic through Cloud Functions written in Node.js and TypeScript. The project avoids committing sensitive configuration data and follows basic best practices for frontend application structure and integration with backend services.

### Technologies Used
Angular, TypeScript, Angular Material, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore / Realtime Database, Firebase Cloud Functions, Node.js

### Key Functional Areas
User authentication and email verification, user profiles, post feed, content creation, reply and comment system, real-time updates, reusable and modular UI components.

This project was built to gain hands-on experience with Angular application design, Firebase integration, and real-time web application behavior, while following clean and maintainable coding practices.
